Calliope, a museum exhibition app
Case Study: Museum goers of New York City need a calendar feed of exhibitions that interest them because they want to schedule more efficiently.

Research:
• Why do users go to museums?
• How much time did they spend at a museum? Why that amount of time?
• When it came to scheduled exhibitions, how did they find out about them? Exhibitions in the past, current, upcoming?

Methods:
• User Interviews: I conducted 7 interviews with New York City residents. A few of the research questions as seen above were asked.

• Affinity Mapping: Organized observations and patterns. 

• Persona: I created Casey, who works a full-time job and many of her museum visits were over the weekends due to time constraints. 

• Competitive Research: It was noted that none of the platforms had the ability to filter by interests very well.

Synthesis
• User Flow
• Feature Prioritization

Prototyping and Usability Testing:
I deviated from my paper prototype when creating the low fidelity wireframes as I realized that many of the users that I interviewed had iPhones. I then focused on making the app more intuitive for the iOS environment. And while I received positive comments on the design, a pain point was feedback on the search results page, which I revised in the prototype.

What's next?
• More usability testing for recent prototype.
• Refine and redesign the search feature, i.e. autofill function.
• Determine the features needed for the website version.
• More testing!
